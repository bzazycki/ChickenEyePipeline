# ChickenEyePipeline

The focus of this project is adapting and improving upon a pipeline created by a former student of Dr. Chun Liang. His pipeline was designed in R, and the **Adapted_R_Pipeline** folder contains my take on his pipeline design. This involved time optimizations, package/method optimizations, and more thorough commenting/documentation. The **Colab_ipynb** subfolder contains code designed to work within the Google Colab environment using rpy2 cell magic. The **Local_Rmd** subfolder contains the same pipeline, only designed to work using RStudio and a local R instance.
